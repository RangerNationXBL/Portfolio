d(p,q) = |p1 - q1| + |p2 - q2|

Euclidean Distance = 
- the measure of a strait line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
  it is widely used in metric in fields such as mathmatics, computer science, 
  and data analysis.

- The length in the hypotenuse in the right triangle
- Pythagorean Theorem
    -d(p,q = sqrt(((p1 - q1) * 2) + ((p2 - p1) * 2)))

- Dimensionality Reduction
    -Third Dimension p in front, q in back

d(p,q)sqrt(((p1 - p2) * 2) + ((p2 - q2) * 2) + ((p3 - q3 ) * 2))
- summation makes this easier and it seems.
    d(p,q) sqrt(sum(pi - qi) * 2)

** I think.
